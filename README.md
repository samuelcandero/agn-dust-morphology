# Undergraduate Research Project (2024 - Present)
Under the guidance of Dr. Vicki Sarajedini at Florida Atlantic University, this project constructs spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for mid-infrared (MIR) variable sources to address two primary objectives. First, the SEDs will be used to validate AGN classifications that were initially based solely on statistical analyses of variability by identifying characteristic AGN emission profiles. Once AGN presence is confirmed, the focus shifts to examining the surrounding dust emission to assess whether there is a discernible relationship between structural disturbances in the host galaxies and the properties of the dust near the central engine. The overarching objective is to determine whether such correlations suggest that merging activity could play a role in initiating accretion processes that lead to AGN activation.

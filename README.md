# Undergraduate Research Project 2024 - Present
Under the guidance of Dr. Vicki Sarajedini at Florida Atlantic University, this project constructs spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for MIR variable sources to achieve two key objectives: first, to validate AGN classifications previously identified solely through variability statistics by confirming characteristic AGN emission profiles; and second, to assess dust emission surrounding the central engine post-confirmation. Subsequently, the morphology of host galaxies will be analyzed to investigate potential correlations between structural disturbance and dust properties. The objective is to determine whether such correlations suggest that merging activity could initiate accretion processes leading to AGN activation.
